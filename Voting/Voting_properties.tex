There are three properties that a voting system should always have in order not to be unfair: 
Anonymity: A voting system should treat all voters equally. I.e. if any two voters trade ballots, this shouldn't change the election's outcome. \\
Concerning the dApp-voting-system, this property could be argued, see TODO-Verweis %\ref{label}
Neutrality: A voting system should treat all candidates equally. I.e. if every voter switched their vote from one candidate to another, the outcome should change accordingly. 
Monotonicity: A voting system should be monotone. I.e. it should be impossible for a candidate to change from winning to losing by gaining additional votes and to change from losing to winning by losing votes without gaining others.
