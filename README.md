### NOS-voting-system-research

Review of voting systems for the context of a ranking tool using a decrentralized ledger. See *voting-paper* folder. 
Notes: The latter includes an implementation also found in root/pseudo-codes.py, an algorithm with one ranking round, using a mean for a bracket systems as well as resulting reward computation. 
Depending on target platform, this will need a rewrite form procedual to class based.
