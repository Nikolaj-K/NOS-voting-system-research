### Considerations: 
The voting system should fulfill the following criteria: 

1) User's values: Reputation, Voting Power (reputation and voting power should be dependent, reputation = voting power possible)

2) Reputation grows if user's vote is in consensus with community's votes 
   a) various ways to predefine what "consensus" does mean
   idea: determine consensus in periods of a week
   b)!!! but users should not be able to vote for apps they haven't used only to get rewarded and users should not be motivated to vote for apps only because they already have a high number of votes and therefore are sure to 
   be in consensus
   idea: reward could be higher for the first voters
   idea: votes should cost
   
3) Reputation decreases if user's vote isn't in consenus with communitys's votes

4) bad apps may be reported by users (= some sort of downvoting in very, very bad cases) 

5) the reputation of users should sink whenever their programmed apps get reported

6) if an app has a large number of reports (limit to be predetermined), users should get a warning before downloading and/or running the app

7) apps' values: number of votes, number of reports;
   evaluation based on: 
   a) usage rate (!!! but apps that are needed more often shouldn't have an advantage over apps that are needed rarely)
   b) number of votes
   c) number of reports
   d) time that an app has been in the market
   e) extent of NOS user base

8) user's reward for a consensus vote should not be dependent from user's voting power or reputation (negative model: steemit)

9) reputation and voting power might be limited 
   a) idea: including a parameter so that at a very high level the increment of reputation converges to 0 

10) data onchain/offchain? 

11) calculation costs
