### dApp-producer ranking Algorithm details
Reward for both quality and quantity, and both should be necessary

### Reviews
* Reward for writing reviers, judged on quality

### Rewards

(note: The python file now contains a more elaborate variant of those ideas)

S(n) ... stake of user n 
V(n) ... "how well" they voted
N=sum over n such that n voted right (that will be rewards) ... all users
M ... total reward
x ... fraction of non-stakedependent rewards
R(n) = (x * M) * f(v) + ((1-x) * M) g(n,S(n)) 
	where f(v) says how good they voted, sum over f(v) is 1
	and where g(n,s) depends on the stake  where n-sum over g(n,s) is 1
	
### On-chain requirements

todo: Write a summary of requirements when it comes to storage and script execution

tldr we need 
	* User accounts with a tine by of on-chain data relating to past actons and current users rankings
	* Readout of users ranking, computation of some numbers
	* The result must definately be on-chain, and if the write-back to the user accounts is doable that would be great as well
