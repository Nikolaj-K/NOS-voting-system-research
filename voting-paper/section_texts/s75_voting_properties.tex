%TODO: specifiy, for which elections (2 candidates etc) the following holds

One way to measure the fairness of a given voting system is to determine some properties that the system should satisfy. 
Commonly, the three properties that a voting system should fulfil in order to be fair are anonymity, neutrality and monotonicity. For two-candidate elections they are defined as follows: \\
{\bf{Anonymity:}} A voting system is said to be anonymous if it treats all voters equally. I.e. if any two voters trade ballots, this shouldn't change the election's outcome. \\
Concerning the dApp-voting-system, this property could be argued. For example, it could be sensible to give users who have a high reputation, which indicates their knowledge, or users who hold a large stake and therefore are likely to want the best for the platform, more voting power than others. Certainly it would establish an unwanted great inequality between users if the relation between voting power and reputation or stake was a linear one. We discuss this topic further in \\%\ref{label} 
%S. 19: Majority rule is the voting system that elects the candidate who receives more than half of the votes, if such a candidate exists. If there is no such candidate, then majority rule results in a tie, with no winner elected. 
{\bf{Neutrality:}} A voting system is said to be neutral if it treats all candidates equally. I.e. if every voter switched their vote from one candidate to another, the outcome should change accordingly. \\
Monotonicity: A voting system is said to be monotone if it is impossible for a candidate to change from winning to losing by gaining additional votes and to change from losing to winning by losing votes without gaining others. \\
The so-called May's Theorem states that majority rule %TODO: see \ref{} 
is the only voting system for two-candidate-elections that is anonymous, neutral, and monotone, and that avoids the possibility of ties. However, majority rule is no option for the dApp-voting-system because there will be more than two candidates and anonymity is no property wanted. \\

%\cite{Handsonapproach} The Mathematics of Voting and Elections: A Hands-On Approach. Chapter One; maybe TODO: quota systems

Some generalisation of majority rule, which majority rule is a special case of, is plurality method. It is the voting system that elects the candidate who receives the largest number of votes, even if that number is less than half of the total number of votes cast. Plurality method only results in a tie, when two or more candidates receive the same number of votes and more than the number of votes received by any of the other candidates. \\
Concerning the dApp-voting-system, the possibility of ties is no downside since there's no need to determine a single winner.\\ %S. 19
Rather, what is needed is a system that leads to some sort of preference order of all dApps. Such preference order produced by the voting system is called ``societal preference order'' since it can be thought of as the ranking of the candidates that, according to the voting system being used, best reflects the voters' will. \\
%n protip: avoid " in TeX
There are various system that can be used to determine the societal preference order. One property of such systems that might sound sensible at first, is the following: \\
A voting system is said to satisfy the majority criterion if whenever a candidate is ranked first by a majority of the voters, that candidate will also be ranked first in the corresponding societal preference order. We give an example for why this would be no legitimate property for the dApp-voting-system in a moment.\\
Some voting system that does not fulfil the majority criterion, is the so-called Borda count which uses a point system to determine overall rankings and is often used in collegiate sports polls for example. In an election with n candidates it works as follows: \\
Firstly, each voter submits a ballot that contains his or her individual preference order of all the candidates. \\
Then points are awarded to each candidate for each ballot cast, according to the following rule: \\
A $m$-place ranking is worth $n-m$ points (where $1\leq m \leq n$). In other words, a first-place ranking is worth $n-1$ points, a second-place ranking is worth $n-2$ points and so on. 
Finally the candidate whose total number of points from all of the ballots is the largest is declared the winner and the corresponding societal preference order is determined by the number of points each candidate has got from largest to smallest. If there is more than one candidate with the largest number of points, a tie occurs. Also some sort of tie occurs in the societal preference order whenever candidates receive the same number of total points. They then occupy consecutive indistinguiable positions in the preference order. \\
Intuitively, Borda count also seems to be quite fair. However, it violates the majority criterion. For the purpose of the dApp-voting-system we consider using some sort of variation of the Borda count more appropriate than sticking to majority criterion. Imagine an extreme situation where a small majority of voters (i.e. users) ranks a specific dApp first place but all of the other voters rank it last on their personal preference. Obviously it would make no sense to declare this dApp the winner and rank it first in a societal preference order. Determining it's rank according to the Borda count seems much more legitimate. So the dApp-voting-system will not fulfil the majority criterion and will not use the plurality method, but rather use some sort of Borda count in order to lead to a sensible societal preference order. \\
Taking account of personal and societal preference orders, for elections with more than two candidates, the three properties of fair voting systems have to be redefined: \\
Anonymity: A voting system is said to be anonymous if it treats all voters equally. I.e. if any two voters traded their personal preference orders, the outcome of the resulting societal preference order should not change. \\
As mentioned before, this is no property we want the dApp-voting-system to fulfil, see \\ %\ref{}. 
Neutrality: A voting system is said to be neutral if it treats all candidates equally. I.e. if every voter switched the positions of two specific candidates on their personal preference orders, the positions of these two candidates in the resulting societal preference order would be switched accordingly. \\
Monotonicity: A voting system is said to be monotone if it is impossible for a candidate to go from winning to losing or to experience a decrease in rank on the resulting societal preference order whenever changes in favour of that candidate, but no changes in disadvantage of that candidate, occur on individual preference ballots. \\
%großes Buch wo alles drinsteht, Chapter Two
Some properties one obviously would want a voting system to fulfill are the following: \\
\begin{enumerate}
\item A candidate who would defeat every other candidate in a head-to-head election (under majority rule) is called a Condorcet winner. 
\item If a candidate would lose to every other candidate in a head-to-head contest (under majority rule) is called a Condorcet loser. 
\item A voting system is said to satisfy the Condorcet winner criterion (CWC), if it always elects the Condorcet winner whenever one exists.
\item A voting system is said to satisfy the Condorcet loser criterion (CLC), if it always elects the Condorcet loser whenever one exists. 
\end{enumerate}
Since the definition of a Condorcet winner involves two-candidate-elections, for a voting system with more than two candidates it is a bit tricky to design it in a way that it fulfills the Condorcet criterion. The Borda count, for example, doesn't fulfill the criterion since it violates majority rule. \\
%But since the Condorcet properties clearly are valuable requirements concerning a voting system, the dApp-store-voting system should fulfill them. The so-called sequential pairwise voting, which is explained in the following lines, does. And as you will see later, the voting system we propose for the dApp-voting-store, which is some kind of mutation of this system, turns out to do so, too.\\ %später zeigen, dass es das Kriterium erfüllt
%Sequential pairwise voting: \\
%To determine the winner and the societal preference order according to sequential pairwise voting, at first, the voters have to choose between two candidates. Majority rule is used to decide the winner. Next, the voters have to choose between the winner of the preceding contest and the next candidate. Then they have to choose between the winner of the latter contest and the next candidate and so on, whereby the winner always is decided according to majority rule. Finally, the winner from the last two-candidate-contest is declared the winner of the whole election. \\
%Though sequential pairwise voting has the benefit of always electing a Condorcet winner if one exists, it comes with great downsides. First of all, it doesn't easily produce a sensible preference order. Furthermore, in sequential pairwise voting, an order in which new candidates are to be introduced into the head-to-head comparisons has to be specified beforehand. And exactly this order, called agenda, has an enormous influence on who wins the election. In other words, it is highly manipulable and violates the fundamental property of neutrality, which is why sequential pairwise voting clearly can't be said to be a fair method.

###### Features for classifications of voting systems

* Plurality voting
* Instant-runoff voting



### Popular voting systems

##### First-past-the-post voting/Winner takes it all
- Voters indicate on a ballot the candidate of their choice, and the candidate who receives the most votes wins. 
- If there are at least two positions two be filled, each voter casts (up to) the same number of votes as there are positions to be filled, and those elected are the highest-placed candidates corresponding to that number of positions. 
- (huge downside: it very much encourages tactical voting)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting 

##### Majority judgement
- Used to determine a single winner. 
- Voters grade each candidate in one of several ranks, for instance named from "excellent" to "bad", and the candidate with the highest median grade is the winner.
- The system's inventors mathematically proved that the system was the most "strategy-resistant" and therefore somehow immune to tactical voting.
- The algorithm we propose is also based on the median grade. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment

##### Approval voting
- Usually used to determine a single winner. 
- Each voter may select any number of candidates. The winner is the candidate who is selected ("approved") most often. 
- Variation: each voter may only select a predetermined number of candidates, otherwise this person's cast votes are invalid. 
- The algorithm we propose also allows each candidate to evaluate an arbitrary numer of candidates, but it is far from being some sort of approval voting. 
https://www.electology.org/approval-voting
https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahl_durch_Zustimmung


##### Closed list voting
- Used when positions are to be filled by members of the running parties. 
- Closed list voting: The voters only can vote for the parties. The elected parties have full decision over who of their members get the positions. 
In praxis, the order in which a party's list candidates get elected can also be predetermined by districts. Then the voting system is called a "local list" system.  

- These systems aren't of any use for our considerations.

#### Preferential voting/Preference voting: 
May refer to different election systems or groups of election systems. Some authors consider preferentiality to be one of the characteristics by which electoral systems can be evaluated and classified. 
Preferential voting may, for example, refer to ranked voting methods/ordinal voting systems, i.e. all election methods that involve ranking candidates in order of preference in a hierarchy on the ordinal scale, the most important ones being instant-runoff voting, single transferable vote and the Borda count.

##### Score voting/rate voting 
- Used to determine a single winner. 
- Voters rate candidates on a scale. The candidate with the highest rating wins.  
- Variations of score voting can use a score-style ballot to elect multiple candidates simultaneously.

TODOTODOTODO: comparison to majority judgement, approval voting and bucklin voting (similarities/differences)

##### Instant-runoff voting 
Used in single-seat elections with more than two candidates 
Voters rank all of the candidates in their personal order of preference
The candidate with the fewest first-choice-votes is eliminated. If there is more than one candidate with the fewest first-choice-votes, the second-choice-votes of these candidates are taken into consideration and so on in order to eliminate only one candidate per voting round. 
In the last voting round there are only two candidates left. The one who gets a majority of first-choice-votes wins the election. 
Variations: There are a few variations of Instant-runoff voting. For example, a candidate could be considered the winner as soon as he/she has a majority of first-choice-votes even though there are more than two candidates left. 
Downside for our purpose: well known (old) dApps are far too hard to be taken over

#### Open list voting
Voters have at least some influence on the order in which a party's candidates are elected. (Example: The candidates are the party's members. Each party has a rank of their members. If a party's candidate reaches a certain quota of the votes, he gets the position even if he's not at the top of the party's list.) 
Open list describes a certain family of voting systems for elections in which multiple candidates are elected through allocations to an electoral listing. What this family has in common is that voters have at least some influence on the order in which a party's candidates are elected. 
In "relatively closed" list systems, a candidate must get a full quota of votes to win a seat. There are various quotas that could be considered for this purpose. 
In "more open" list systems, that quota is so low that it's possible that more of a party's candidates achieve the quota than the total number of seats won by the party. Therefore it should be constituted in advance whether the party's list ranking or the total number of each candidates' votes takes precedence if this happens.
In the "most open" list system, the total number of votes each candidate has received utterly determines the election result. 
In a "free list" system/panachage electors even have more power over which candidates are elected than in the systems above, because each elector is given as many votes as there are seats to be filled and is allowed to cast more than one vote to the very same candidate.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_list; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation

##### Bucklin voting/The Grand Junction System: 
- Usually used to determine a single winner. 
- Each voter ranks the candidates in ascending order, the first one being the favorite and the last one being the worst candidate. 
- To evaluate the votings, at first the prime rank is considered. Each candidate gains a score as high as the number of voters that ranked him first. If a candidate's total votes reach a majority (i.e. more than half of the number of voters), this candidate is the winner of the election. If not, the second rank is taken into consideration. 
- The number of votes each candidate received at the second rank is added to the number of votes from the first rank. If a candidates number of votes reaches the majority (i.e. more than half of the number of voters), this candidate wins the election. Otherwise the procedure continues until a candidate with a majority vote is found. The winner then is the candidate with the most votes accumulated.

#### Ranked voting/Ordinal voting systems 
Ranked voting describes certain voting systems in which voters rank outcomes in a hierarchy on the ordinal scale (ordinal voting systems).
